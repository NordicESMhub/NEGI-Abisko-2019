# Visualize and analyze in python

Examples for analyzing and visualizing data in python are available [here](https://github.com/daliagachc/negi-stuff).

To get it on the [Jupyterhub](https://abisko.uiogeo-apps.sigma2.no), open a [terminal](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/terminal.html) and clone the repository:


```shell
git clone https://github.com/daliagachc/negi-stuff.git
```

Then browse into the folders. The notebooks presented during the NEGI-Abisko lecture are in `negi-stuff/negi_stuff/presentations/intro_jlab/`.
