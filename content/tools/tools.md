## Tools to explore netCDF files


Here is a non exhaustive list of tools/software you can use to post-process and visualize [netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) files:

### <span style="color:red">CDO (Climate Data Operators)</span>

CDO is a collection of command-line operators to manipulate and analyze climate and numerical weather prediction data and can manipulate model outputs (netCDF). 
CDO provides more than 350 operators!

- [CDO Reference Card](https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo/embedded/cdo_refcard.pdf)
- [CDO Tutorial](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/wiki/Tutorial)

### <span style="color:red">NCO (netCDF Operators)</span>

NCO is a suite of programs designed to perform certain "operations" on netCDF files, i.e., things like averaging, concatenating, subsetting, or metadata manipulation.

### <span style="color:red">Ncview: a netCDF visual browser</span>

Ncview is one of the simplest visual browser for netCDF format files. 
If you want to learn more about ncview:
- See a [screenshot](http://cirrus.ucsd.edu/~pierce/software/ncview/ncview_screenshot.gif) of ncview in action.

### <span style="color:red">Python programming language</span>

Python is a general purpose programming and scripting language which includes powerful visualisation and data analysis tools. Matplotlib is a general purpose plotting library gioving Python the power of MatLab. NetCDF files can be read using the NetCDF4 library and/or Xarray. The most common distribution of Python for scientific use is the [Anaconda distribution](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html).

### <span style="color:red">Useful Shell command (loops, etc.)</span>
