# Getting access to Jupyterhub

Instructions for accessing Jupyter notebooks at Sigma2 server:

  - you should have received an email message titled "JupyterHub links for NeGi-Abisko-2019"
    - if not please request it to the course organizers 
  - follow "invitation link" in the email message 
    - If you don't already have a **Feide guest** user account (otherwise skip this step), click "Feide guest users". 
    - register a new account 
      - for the sake of simplicity try to use the same email that you are using for the course 
      - also try to use the same (or similar) user ID that you have for github 
      - finish the registration process
  - click again on the "invitation link" in the email
    - login with "Feide guest users"
      - accept the different policies
      - agree to become a member of the EScience-Abisko
    - the browser should display the message "Loading group details" 
  - now go to [Abisko Jupyterhub](http://abisko.uiogeo-apps.sigma2.no)
    - click "Sign in with Dataporten"
    - login with Feide Guest User 
  - finally the web browser should display a page with "jupyterlab" on the upper left side
  - for later usage of the notebooks just use the [Abisko Jupyterhub link](http://abisko.uiogeo-apps.sigma2.no/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com//NordicESMHub/NEGI-Abisko-2019&branch=gh-pages&subPath=content%2Fintro.md&app=lab)
