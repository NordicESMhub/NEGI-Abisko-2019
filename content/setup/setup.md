# Getting ready for Abisko!

We will be using a wide range of computing and storage facilities ranging from your local laptop to Norwegian National Storage and cloud computing.


- Use your laptop for prototyping your code on sample dataset: this will allow you to work anywhere even without any available WIFI connection.
- Use [Abisko Jupyterhub](http://abisko.uiogeo-apps.sigma2.no/) for processing large amount of data and running your code in *production* mode.

We may also use additional cloud computing, not directly connected to the Norwegian Infrastructure for Research Data (NIRD) if needed. The setup for these resources is very much the same than for the Abisko Jupyterhub (the same packages are available) and NIRD storage can be accessed via [sshfs](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_shell_file_system).

These Virtual Machines are available on demand. Ask your assistant for additional information.
